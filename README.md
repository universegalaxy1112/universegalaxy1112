### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated software engineer with over 5 years of experience in web applications and cross-platform mobile development. Collaboration and effective communication are integral to my work ethos, as I am deeply committed to being a team player.

As a problem solver at heart, I take immense pride in writing clean code and adhering to best practices. Being a self-starter, I am highly organized, and responsible, and consistently strive for personal growth and development.

One of the notable projects I had the privilege to contribute to was Chris Bunstead's React Native app. This experience further refined my expertise in React Native development, and I'm proud to have been a part of creating an innovative mobile application.

During my time at Invideo Innovation Pte. Ltd., I had the pleasure of working with an exceptional team, which not only enhanced my skills but also fostered a collaborative work environment that I thrive in.
Additionally, outside of work, I have pursued a personal interest in machine learning, showcasing my passion for continuously expanding my knowledge.

Apart from coding, I find joy in pursuing my hobbies. Music has always been a source of inspiration and relaxation for me. I also enjoy playing football, which allows me to stay active and be part of a team in a different context. Additionally, spending quality time with friends during nice evenings out is something I cherish as it helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
